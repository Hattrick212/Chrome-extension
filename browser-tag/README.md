Sample that shows how to use the [browser tag](http://developer.chrome.com/trunk/apps/app_external.html#browsertag) in an app to create a mini browser.

The app's main window contains a `<browser>` that is sized to fit most of it (via the `width` and `height` attributes). The location bar is used to update its `src` attribute.
