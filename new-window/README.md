# New Window API

Sample that shows how to use the [New Window
API](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/tags/webview#event-newwindow) for
[webviews](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_external.html#webview). The
app behaves like a tabbed browser. New tabs that are created by clicking
links in a webview use the New Window API to maintain the scripting
relationship generally expected by the current and new window in a
multi-window (or tabbed) browsing session.
