- Very simple Zephyr HXM client
- Uses the experimental bluetooth API to fetch heart rate data from a Zephyr HXM device
- Uses http://www.highcharts.com/ to display the data inside of a sandboxed iframe

Caveats:
- The bluetooth API is only available on Chrom(e|ium)OS
- Resource clean-up isn't happening properly yet: you will likely have to disable/enable bluetooth between runs of the program or the connection will fail
